    <p id="sentinel" class="test_class">In education, computational thinking (CT) is a set of problem-solving methods that involve expressing problems and their solutions in ways that a computer could execute. It involves the mental skills and practices for designing computations that get computers to do jobs for us, and  explaining and interpreting the world as a complex of information processes. Those ideas range from basic CT for beginners to advanced CT for experts.</p>
